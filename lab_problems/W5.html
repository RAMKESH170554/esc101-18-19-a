<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
The family of Mr. C is super rich. Each sibling of Mr. C has a single but vast piece of land in the outskirts of Kanpur city. The shape of the lands owned by siblings of Mr C can be either a square or a triangle. They want to sell their lands but they don’t have the information about its area. All they know is the shape of their land and length of sides. They ask Mr. C to help them with the calculation of the area.<br />
<br />
You are given as input, the shape of the land (represented as an integer as shown below). If the shape is a square, you are given its side length. If the shape is a triangle, then all three side lengths are given. Side lengths may be given as <b>non-integers</b>. Print the name of the shape and its area <b>rounded to three decimal places</b>. These two outputs must be printed on <b>different lines</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Use <b>double variables</b> and double typecasting while doing area calculations to avoid loss of precision. Do not use float variables and float typecasting.<br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>A square is represented by the integer 0<br />
<li>A triangle is represented by the integer 1<br />
<li>To calculate the area of triangle, Mr. C recalls the Heron’s formula from his high school. If a, b, c are the side lengths of a triangle, then if we let s = (a + b + c)/2 then<br />
$$area = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$$<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
A positive integer is called a perfect number if the sum of proper divisors of that number is equal to the number itself. When you go back home, you can read more about this here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number (however, DO NOT BROWSE these websites during the lab).<br />
<br />
The proper divisors of a number are all those numbers, except the number itself, which divide that number. Thus, 1 is a proper divisor of every number but 1 itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are: 1, 2 and 3. Clearly, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. Thus, 6 is a perfect number.<br />
<br />
You will be given <b>a positive number as an int</b> as input and you will have to give two outputs in <b>two different lines</b>. In the first line, give the sum of the proper divisors of that number and in the second line, print "YES" (without quotes) if the number is a perfect number, otherwise print "NO".<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>This question will require you to use loops. We are giving below, the general structure of a loop, to help you.<br />
</ol><br />
<br />
<b>HINTS</b>: <br />
<ol><br />
<li>A loop is written as follows<br />
int counter;<br />
for(counter = 1; counter <= 5; counter++){<br />
    // Do something with the counter<br />
}<br />
<li>You can change the initial value 1, final value 5, and the update step as you wish.<br />
<li>Inside a for loop, you can put in any number of statements.<br />
<li>Be careful that the sum of the divisors of a number may not fit inside the int datatype even if the number itself is int datatype. To avoid such errors, use the long datatype to perform computations.<br />

<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>In particular, for the number 40, we want the text "Forty" (without the quotes) and not the string "Forty " (note the extra space at the end).<br />
<li>Please note that the evaluation may show you that you have passed the test case even if you write "Forty ". However, the final autograder will give you zero marks if you do this.<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
The Fibonacci sequence forms one of the most important number series in the nature. Many natural phenomenon follows this sequence. However, we will look at an even more general class of sequences known as Lucas sequences in this question. You will be given three <b>integers</b>, P, Q, n. n will always be non-negative.<br />
<br />
Given P, Q, the Lucas numbers of the first kind are defined as follows<br />
$$\begin{align}<br />
L_0 &= 0\\<br />
L_1 &= 1\\<br />
L_n &= P \cdot L_{n-1} - Q \cdot L_{n-2},\qquad\text{for } n \geq 2<br />
\end{align}$$<br />
You will first have to output L_5 for the given value of P and Q. In <b>the next line</b> you will have to output L_n for the given value of P and Q.<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Remember that n can be 0 or 1 too<br />
<li>Remember that P, Q can be negative or positive integers too<br />
<li>Lucas numbers can grow very very quickly. Use a long datatype to perform all your computations.<br />
<li>All Lucas numbers are integers. Using float or double variables will result in errors.<br />
<li>You may use copy-paste to avoid typing code to the print the first and second lines twice. However, be careful not to make typing errors while doing so.<br />

<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
You will be given two <b>strictly positive integer</b> (i.e. positive and non-zero) N and another <b>non-negative integer</b> K. We promise that the integers will not contain any leading zeros i.e. we will never give you N as 0123 or 00123 -- instead we will always give N as 123 i.e. the first digit of N in the way we give it to you will always be non-zero. You will have output two things on <b>two different lines</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>On the first line, print the number of digits in the number N<br />
<li>On the second line, print "YES" (without quotes) if the sum of the first K digits of N is greater than K*K. If not, print "NO" (without quotes).<br />
</ol><br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />

<b>HINTS</b>: <br />
<ol><br />
<li>The function log10(n) available from math.h gives you back the base 10 logarithm of a number n. This function can help you in finding the number of digits in an integer n.<br />
<li>We can extract the first i.e. leading digit of any integer n by using the formula<br />
$$(\text{int})(n/\text{pow}(10,len - 1))$$<br />
where len is the number of digits in n.<br />

There will be partial grading in this question. There are two lines in your output. Printing each line correctly, in the correct order, carries 50% weightage. Each visible test case is worth 2 points and each hidden test case is worth 4 points. There are 2 visible and 4 hidden test cases.<br />
<br />
Please remember, however, that when you press Submit/Evaluate, you will get a green bar only if all parts of your answer are correct. Thus, if your answer is only partly correct, Prutor will say that you have not passed that test case completely, but when we do autograding afterwards, you will get partial marks.<h3>All Test Cases (Visible + Hidden)</h3><table border = "1"><tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th><tr><td>5 1</td><td>1<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
In a planet called Vormir, there is a weird system for determining friendship between two persons.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>If the <b>number of even digits</b> in their telephone numbers are the same, then the two persons are friends<br />
<li>If two persons are not friends but the <b>sum of the number of even digits</b> in their telephone numbers is even, then they are acquaintances.<br />
<li>If two persons are neither friends nor acquaintances, they are enemies.<br />
</ul><br />
<br />
It is known that the planet has an <b>eight digit phone number</b> system. Write a program which takes as input, two phone numbers given as <b>positive integers</b> separated by a space and first prints the total number of even digits in each phone number, <b>separated by a space</b>, then in a <b>new line</b>, prints the relationship of the two people (Friends, Acquaintances, Enemies).<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Be careful not to make spelling mistakes in the output. The label should be either of "Friends", "Acquaintances", or "Enemies" (without quotes)<br />
<li>0 is considered and even number<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
There is a famous legend related to the origin of the game of chess. There was an emperor who was very impressed by this game and wished to reward the inventor. The conversation between them is given below. In this world however, the chessboard only has 7 squares on each side, for a total of 49 squares on the board.<br />
<br />
<b>Emperor</b>: Name your reward, O wise one!<br />
<b>Inventor</b>: O generous emperor, my wish is simple. I only wish for this -- give me one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the next square, four for the next, eight for the next and so on for all 49 squares, with each square having double the number of grains as the square before.<br />
<br />
We will provide you with the number of rice grains present with the emperor as a <b>long integer</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>If the king is able to fulfill his promise with those many rice grains, print <b>YES</b> in the first line and then in the <b>next line</b>, print how many grains of rice he will be left with after fulfilling his promise.<br />
<li>If the king is not able to fulfill his promise with those many grains of rice, print <b>NO</b> in the first line and then in the <b>next line</b>, print the last square he was able to <b>completely fill</b>. This will be a number between 0 and 49.<br />
</ol><br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>The number of rice grains can be very large. Use a long type variable to do calculations.<br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
