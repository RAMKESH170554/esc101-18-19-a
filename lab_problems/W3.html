<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
FIFA World Cup is a global footballing event in which nations compete to win the coveted title of World Champion. This year’s cup was held in Russia and was a delight to watch from a neutral point of view. Not so much if you were wishing for the biggies to win. There were so many surprises in this year’s edition: Germany getting knocked out at group stage, Argentina being humbled by eventual winners France, and Croatia showing grit and will to reach their maiden Final.<br />
<br />
In the first line of input you are given an integer representing the team. You are then provided the scores of three matches of that team: a - b, c - d, e – f where a, c, e represent goals scored by the team, and b, d, f represent goals scored against them. You need to compute the goal difference: total goals scored by them minus the total goals scored<br />
against them.<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Do not use any libraries other than stdio.h<br />
<li>Be careful of extra/missing spaces and extra/missing lines. Use the visible test cases to guide yourself.<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
You are given two 3 x 3 floating point matrices A and B. The rows of the matrices will be given in different lines, one row in each line and there will be a blank line between the two matrices. The different entries of the matrix will be separated by a single space. Let’s define matrices C and D as follows:<br />
C = A + B<br />
D = A x B<br />
You have to print C and D as described in the output format. The elements of the output matrices should have only 2 digits beyond decimal point.<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Print each row of the matrices C and D on <b>separate lines</b>, with a single space between 2 matrix entries in the same row.<br />
<li>Include <b>two blank lines</b> between printing the matrices C and D.<br />
</ol><br />
<br />
<b>HINT</b>: To print a floating point number, we use the notation %f in printf statements. To print a floating point number to only 2 digits beyond the decimal point, use the notation %0.2f in your printf statements.<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
You are given the equation of three lines in three variables. The equations will only contain integer values. Consider the 3 x 3 matrix formed by this system of equations. Find the three minors of this matrix corresponding to the three elements in the first row of this matrix (in order) as well as the determinant of this matrix. Output these four numbers in four different lines.<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
A Round Robin tournament is one in which a contestant meets all other contestants in turn. If each contestant plays all other contestants twice, then this is called double round robin tournament. Football leagues around the world follow the double round robin format, in which teams play all other teams twice, once at their own stadium, designated as ‘Home’ match and once at their opponent’s stadium, called ‘Away’ match.<br />
<br />
You will be given the goal data of two of the teams in this double round robin tournament in the format described below.<br />
TeamID1 a1 - b1, c1 - d1<br />
TeamID2 a2 - b2, c2 - d2<br />
where TeamID1 is the integer ID for team1. a1 and c1 represent goals scored by team1 in its two matches, and b1, d1 represent goals scored against team1 in those two matches. Similarly for team2 with ID TeamID2.<br />
<br />
A points table is a table which shows the points scored by all the teams in the tournament. You have to output this table for the two teams for whom you have been given data. In the following, GF stands for Goals For, GA stands for Goals Against, and GD stands for Goal Difference. Your table will have four columns, and three rows:<br />
<ol><br />
<li>The first row will contain the text headings ID, GF, GA, and GD.<br />
<li>The second row with contain the text ID of team1, followed by the total goals scored by team1, followed by total goals scored against team1, followed by the goal difference.<br />
<li>The third row with the same details, but for team2.<br />
<li>You have to ensure that the first characters in each of the columns should be aligned vertically with the corresponding column heading. Use the tab character (with escape sequence ‘\t’) between ID and GF, GF and GA and GD columns to achieve this.<br />
</ol><br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Press Evaluate/Submit once without writing any code to see how the output is expected.<br />
<li>Use the tab character instead of space between two entries of two side-by-side columns.<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
The FIFA World Cup is a global footballing event in which nations compete to win the coveted title of World Champion. This year’s cup was held in Russia and was a delight to watch from a neutral point of view. Not so much if you were wishing for the biggies to win. There were so many surprises in this year’s edition: Germany getting knocked out at group stage, Argentina being humbled by eventual winners France, and Croatia showing grit and will to reach their maiden Final.<br />
<br />
In the first line of input you are given the team number which will be an <b>integer</b> and in the second line, you are provided the scores of three matches played by that team: a - b, c - d, e - f where a, c, e are <b>integers</b> representing goals scored by that team, and b, d, f are <b>integers</b> representing  goals scored against that team by the opponent team.<br />
<br />
The goal ratio of a match is defined as the ratio of goal scored by the team to the goals scored against that team. You need to compute the <b>sum of goal ratios</b> of all three matches in the format given below. The output should be rounded off to 3 places beyond the decimal point.<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>We are asking for the sum of the goal ratios of the three matches.<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
In last week’s lab we talked about a Lego safe in which your friend wanted to give you a secret digit. The safe is to be built using lego blocks. Last time you sent an image of the number in the safe to your friend as a proof of your trustworthiness. Seeing the image that you had sent, your friend agrees that you are indeed trustworthy, and now wants to use this safe for his task. He will provide two safes, each containing <b>an integer</b>, and you have to return the arithmetic mean of the given two numbers in a new safe. The new safe is constructed by replacing ‘#’ with a character with a 'O' symbol (capital letter O). Note that for greater security, the bars of the new safe also have four more ‘-’ symbols. The arithmetic mean stored in the safe should have <b>only one digit beyond the decimal point</b>.<br />

----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
You are given a rational number N with 6 digits after the decimal point. You have to first output the number formed by the digits after the decimal place - call this number P. Then find the number formed by reversing the six digits (call this new number Q) and output the sum P+Q on <b>a different line</b>. For example if the number is 123.456789, then P = 456789 and Q = 987654 and so the output should be 456789 and 1444443. Both outputs should be given on two separate lines.<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Give both numbers on different lines<br />
<li>Note that you don't have to output the digits themselves i.e. if the digits after the decimal place are 0, 0, 5, 6, 1, 2, you have to output 5612 and not 005612.<br />
<li>Be careful that there is no guarantee how many digits the number has <i>before</i> the decimal point. Only the number of digits after the decimal point are known to be 6.<br />
</ol><br />

<li>You may require the use of math.h functions for which math.h has been included for you. However, it is <b>not necessary to use math.h functions</b> to solve this problem.<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
Loans and interest are crucial to modern economy. The argument for interest is as follows: It is preferable to receive a given good now rather than in the future and therefore interest is compensation for the time the lender forgoes the benefit of spending the money. You are given the following quantities<br />
<ol><br />
<li>principal amount P<br />
<li>annual rate of interest R (in %)<br />
<li>first duration of time in years T1<br />
<li>second duration of time in years T2<br />
<li>number of times interest is compounded per year N<br />
</ol><br />
All the above quantities will be provided to you as <b>integers</b>. You need to give the following outputs <b>on different lines</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>total interest accrued if simple interest is applied for T1 years<br />
<li>if after T1 years of simple interest, we start applying compound interest for T2 years (compounded N times a year), then total compound interest accrued in those T2 years.<br />
<li>total interest accrued if we had just applied simple interest for T1 + T2 years<br />
<li>total interest accrued if we had just applied compound interest for T1 + T2 years (compounded N times a year)<br />
</ol><br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>All outputs ask for interest amounts, not final amounts.<br />
<li>All the <b>outputs should be rounded to 3 places</b> beyond the decimal point.<br />
<li>Use double variables for all your computations. <b>Do not use float</b> as it may cause you loss of precision.<br />
</ol><br />
<b>HINT</b>: You may require the use of functions from the math.h library which has been included for you. The formula for calculating the <b>final amount</b> if interest is compounded N times a year for T years at R% rate with principal P is $$P*(1+R/(100*N))^{N*T}$$<br />
