<h1>LAB-PRAC-04_COND</h1><h2>Trouble with Triangles (p1v1d1)</h2><hr><b>Trouble with Triangles [10 marks]</b><br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
You will be provided the side lengths of a triangle in increasing order, <b>separated by commas</b>. Side lengths will be <b>strictly positive integers</b>. Depending on the input, you have to output <b>only one</b> of the following labels<br />
<ol><br />
<li><b>Invalid</b>: if the lengths provided cannot belong to a triangle. Remember that 3 positive integers can form the sides of a valid triangle if and only if the sum of any two of the side lengths is larger than or equal to the length of the third side. That means that if we have side lengths a, b, c, then for these to form a triangle, we must have<br />
$$\begin{align}a + b &\geq c\\b + c &\geq a\\c + a &\geq b\end{align}$$<br />
The above inequalities are often called the <b>triangle inequalities</b>.<br />
<li><b>Equilateral</b>: if all sides of the triangle are equal<br />
<li><b>Isosceles</b>: if any two sides of the triangle are equal<br />
<li><b>Scalene</b>: if all sides of the triangle are unequal<br />
</ol><br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Output only one label. If you feel that more than one label applies to the triangle, please follow the rules given below.<br />
<ol><br />
<li>If the side lengths are invalid, for example 3, 4, 8, print only "Invalid" (without quotes) for this case. Do not print "Scalene" or "Isosceles" for such examples since they do not form valid triangles.<br />
<li>If all side lengths are equal, for example 5, 5, 5, print only "Equilateral" in this case. Do not print "Isosceles" in this case.<br />
</ol><br />
<li>Side lengths will be integers and be given in increasing order.<br />

<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
Ms. Mathematica really loves numbers but some numbers are more loved than others. Currently, she likes complex numbers which have special real and imaginary coefficients. She needs your help to find out if a given complex number is her favorite or not.<br />
<br />
You will be given a complex number n = a + bi in a format described below, with both the real and imaginary parts being <b>4-digit integers</b> and an integer m, on <b>two separate lines</b>. Your job is to output the following in <b>two different lines</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>The sum of the digits of the real part a of the number n and the product of the digits of the imaginary part b of the number n. Both numbers should be output on the same line, <b>separated by a comma and a space</b><br />
<li> If both the sum and product values you calculated above are divisible by m then print â€œFavorite" (without the quotes), else print "Not favorite" (without the quotes).<br />
</ol><br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Both the sum and the product should be output on the same line (the first line) and be separated by a single comma and a single space.<br />
<li>Output the sum and product as integers with no leading zeros or decimal points etc.<br />
<li>The four digit numbers we give you as a and b, may have zeros in their representation.<br />

Total marks: <b>[20 Points]</b><br />
<br />
There will be partial grading in this question. There are two lines in your output. Printing each line correctly, in the correct order, carries 50% weightage. Each visible test case is worth 2 points and each hidden test case is worth 4 points. There are 2 visible and 4 hidden test cases.<br />
<br />
Please remember, however, that when you press Submit/Evaluate, you will get a green bar only if all parts of your answer are correct. Thus, if your answer is only partly correct, Prutor will say that you have not passed that test case completely, but when we do autograding afterwards, you will get partial marks.<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
The Kanpur city has a growing problem of particulate matter (PM) pollution. IITK researchers are trying to help measure and correct the problem. You will be given four quantities in <b>four different lines</b> in a format described below -- all four quantities will be <b>non-integer</b>. On the first line, we will give you a threshold, and then on the next three lines we will give you PM pollution levels in Kanpur for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, say PM1, PM2 and PM3. <b>Assume that the PM pollution level on Sunday is always 1.0</b> (since being a holiday PM levels are less).<br />
<br />
You have to output the following on <b>four different lines</b>.<br />
<ol><br />
<li>For each day Mon, Tue, Wed, if the PM level on that day minus the level on the previous day is <b>greater than or equal to</b> the threshold, print High (see below for exact format) else print Low.<br />
<li>Print the output for every day on a different line.<br />
<li>For Monday, take Sunday as the previous day for which PM level is given above.<br />
<li>If the number of days where your answer above was high is <b>less than</b> two, output 0.000 on the fourth line. If the number of such days is <b>greater than or equal to</b> two, then print the following quantity <b>rounded to three decimal places</b> in the fourth line<br />
$$\sqrt{\frac{PM1^2 + PM2^2 + PM3^2}3}$$<br />
</ol><br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Using float variables to read and perform calculations should be sufficient. In other words, you should not require the use of double variables in this question.<br />
<li>Although you may use copy (CTRL+C) and paste (CTRL+V) to avoid typing similar code again and again, be careful to not make mistakes while doing so.<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
In a week's time, all Indian citizens who are income tax assessees will have to file their tax returns (your instructor is one of them). Can you help your instructor file his taxes? The Indian tax code for personal income is a bit more complicated so we will use a simplified tax code below. Let the income of Mr C be Rupees X<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Slab 1: If X is less than or equal to 100,000, no tax is to be paid<br />
<li>Slab 2: If X is greater than 100,000 but less than or equal to 200,000, then tax paid is 10% of (X-100,000)<br />
<li>Slab 3: If X is greater than 200,000 but less than or equal to 300,000, then tax paid is 10,000 + 20% of (X-200,000)<br />
<li>Slab 4: If X is greater than 300,000, then tax paid is 30,000 + 30% of (X-300,000)<br />
</ol><br />
You will be given an income value as a <b>positive integer</b>. You have to give output in <b>two lines</b>. In the first line you have to output which Slab does the income fall in and in the second line you have to output the total tax <b>rounded off to two decimal places</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>The commas in the amounts above are just for ease of reading. Do not put commas in numbers when coding. Mr. C does not understand commas inside integers.<br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Carefully read the tax code. Do not make mistakes between "greater than" and "greater than or equal to"<br />

There will be partial grading in this question. There are four lines in your output. Printing each line correctly, in the correct order, carries 25% weightage. Each visible test case is worth 2 points and each hidden test case is worth 4 points. There are 2 visible and 4 hidden test cases.<br />
<br />
Please remember, however, that when you press Submit/Evaluate, you will get a green bar only if all parts of your answer are correct. Thus, if your answer is only partly correct, Prutor will say that you have not passed that test case completely, but when we do autograding afterwards, you will get partial marks.<h3>All Test Cases (Visible + Hidden)</h3><table border = "1"><tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th><tr><td>(1, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 4) (5, 1)</td><td>f(2) = 4<br />

<br />
<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
Suppose we have 3 positive numbers A, B, C, and are given a year Y. Using these we define 3 rules as given below<br />
<ol><br />
<li><b>Rule 1</b>: If Y is divisible by A, we <b>call</b> Y a super leap year<br />
<li><b>Rule 2</b>: If Y is divisible by A but is also divisible by B, we <b>don't call</b> Y a super leap year<br />
<li><b>Rule 3</b>: If Y is divisible by A but is also divisible by both B and C, we <b>call</b> Y a super leap year<br />
</ol><br />
Any year that is not called a super leap year is called a super common year.<br />
<br />
You will be given a year Y, as a <b>positive integer</b>, as well as four numbers, A, B, C, N, all four given as <b>positive integers</b>, in a format given below. <b>The number N will be either 1, 2 or 3</b>. You have to output the following two labels in two different lines.<br />
<ol><br />
<li>Apply rules 1, 2, and 3 with Y, A, B, C to find if Y is called a super leap year or not. If it is a super leap year, print "Leap" (without quotes) else print "Common" (without quotes).<br />
<li>Apply only rules from rule 1 till rule N with Y, A, B, C to find if Y is called a super leap year or not. If it is a super leap year, print "Leap" (without quotes) else print "Common" (without quotes). Remember that the number N will be either 1, 2 or 3.<br />
</ol><br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>For example, if N = 2, then in the second line, you only have to apply rules 1 and 2 to find out if Y is a super leap year or not. If N = 1, then in the second line, you only have to apply rule 1 to find out if Y is a super leap year or not.<br />
<li>In the first line, all three rules must be applied to find out whether the year is a super leap year or not, irrespective of the value of N.<br />
<li>Note that there are no restrictions on A, B, C other than that they are positive integers. A, B, C need not be in increasing or decreasing order. A need not divide B or C or vice versa etc etc.<br />

<b>Problem Statement</b><br />
Your instructor teaches another large course called CS771: Introduction to Machine Learning. Help him perform grading for that course. You will be given the total marks scored by a student out of 100, say M, the percentage of lectures the student has attended, say A, and a attendance weightage out of 100, say W. <b>All numbers will be given as an integer</b>.<br />
<br />
The grade of a student is calculated by using their <i>effective marks</i>. If the marks of a student M are <b>greater than or equal to 50</b> then their effective marks is M itself. Otherwise, the effective marks is calculated as the <b>integer portion</b> of the following quantity (M + W% of A) i.e. by discarding digits after the decimal place. For example, if M = 33, A = 50 and W = 50 then effective marks will be (33 + 50% of 50) = (33 + 25) = 58. If the above calculation gives effective marks as <b>greater than 100</b>, then the effective marks is set to 100.<br />
<br />
Given the effective marks of a student, grading is done using the following chart.<br />
<table class="table table-bordered"><br />
	<tr><th>Marks</th><th>Grade</th></tr><br />
        <tr><td>0-49</td><td>D</td></tr><br />
        <tr><td>50-69</td><td>C</td></tr><br />
        <tr><td>70-89</td><td>B</td></tr><br />
        <tr><td>90-100</td><td>A</td></tr><br />
</table><br />
<br />
You have to give your output in four lines as shown below<br />
<ol><br />
<li>In the first line, output the effective marks of the student <b>as an integer</b><br />
<li>In the second line, print the grade the student got<br />
<li>In the third line, print the grade the student would have got if their marks were the same but attendance was 0%<br />
</ol><br />
<br />
<b>Caution</b><br />
<ol><br />
<li>Be careful about extra/missing lines and extra/missing spaces.<br />
<li>Be careful that in the third line, the case may be such that the effective marks of the student changes due to change in attendance.<br />
<li>You may be tempted to use copy-paste while coding this question. Be careful while doing so to avoid making errors.<br />
