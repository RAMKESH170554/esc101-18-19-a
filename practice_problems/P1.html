<h1>BONUS-PRAC-02</h1><h2>Monsters Multiply (p1v1d1)</h2><hr>Your task is to take two long integers from the user and print their product. The input will be given in the following format<br />
number1 * number2<br />
Note that there is a multiplication symbol between the two numbers. Your output should be the product of these two numbers in a single line. Remember that long integers can take values between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (the commas are given just for sake of ease for humans, Mr C will not be able to understand these commas and give errors so don't use commas inside numbers in your code).<br />
<br />
There is no standard datatype in C that can store such large integers so you will have to find some clever way to store the product of these big numbers. Also remember that one or both numbers can be negative too.<br />
<br />
There are 4 visible test cases worth 0 marks each i.e. they are not worth any marks. The visible test cases are there just to show you where you are making mistakes. There are 10 hidden test cases worth 2 marks each.<br />

EXAMPLE1<br />
Input:<br />
1233456890 * 9876543210<br />
Output:<br />

<br />
EXAMPLE2<br />
Input:<br />
112233445566778899 * -998877665544332211<br />
Output:<br />

<br />
You are <b>NOT ALLOWED</b> to use libraries other than stdio.h. You will be penalized if you use any library other than stdio.h (so do not use math.h, string.h or any other library). You <b>ARE ALLOWED</b> to use conditional statements (if-else, switch-case, ternary operators) and loops (for, while, do-while) if you know how to use them. You are allowed to use int, long, float, char and double type variables. You may use arrays (i.e. you can use integer arrays or character arrays) but you cannot use string.h. You may define your own functions if you know how to define functions in C.<br />
<br />
Your code will be autograded for marks but TAs will look at your code as well to check for copying and other violations. Copying will lead to a straight 0 and further disciplinary action. Violating the above rules (e.g. using string.h) will result in penalties.<br />
<br />
<b>DEADLINE FOR BONUS PROBLEM</b>: Your deadline for submitting your solution to the bonus problems is Sunday, August 12, 11:59PM IST. After this time has passed, Prutor will shut down the bonus problem and you would not be able to make any more submissions. Please do not forget to press submit on your code.<br />
<br />
<b>CAUTION</b>: DO NOT COPY CODE FROM EACH OTHER and DO NOT COPY CODE FROM THE INTERNET. We will scan your code using plagiarism detection software. If we find copying has been done between students, or some student has copied code from the internet, we will ban that student from all bonus problems in the course and may also initiate disciplinary action.<h3>All Test Cases (Visible + Hidden)</h3><table border = "1"><tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th><tr><td>10 * 10</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>1233456890 * 9876543210</td><td>12182290271757216900</td></tr><tr><td>112233445566778899 * -998877665544332211</td><td>-112107482103740987777903741240815689</td></tr><tr><td>101010101010101010 * 202020202020202020</td><td>20406081012141618161412100806040200</td></tr><tr><td>120 * 20</td><td>2400</td></tr><tr><td>-12345 * -98765</td><td>1219253925</td></tr><tr><td>-123456789 * 200</td><td>-24691357800</td></tr><tr><td>987654321 * 987654321</td><td>975461057789971041</td></tr><tr><td>9223372036854775807 * 1000000000000000000</td><td>9223372036854775807000000000000000000</td></tr><tr><td>9223372036854775807 * 9223372036854775807</td><td>85070591730234615847396907784232501249</td></tr><tr><td>9223372036854775807 * -9223372036854775808</td><td>-85070591730234615856620279821087277056</td></tr><tr><td>-9223372036854775808 * -9223372036854775808</td><td>85070591730234615865843651857942052864</td></tr><tr><td>1234567900987654321 * 1234567890987654321</td><td>1524157889803383633104709647789971041</td></tr><tr><td>8888888888888888888 * 7777777777777777777</td><td>69135802469135802455308641975308641976</td></tr></table><hr><hr></body>
