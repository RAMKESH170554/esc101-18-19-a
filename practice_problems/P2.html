<h1>PRACTICE-02_SCAN-PRINT</h1><h2>The Missing Text (p1v1d1)</h2><hr><p>I want to print the following statement</p><br />
<p>India has 29 states and 7 union territories</p><br />
<p>However, the code shown here is not producing the complete sentence. Moreover, compilation generates a warning. Fix the code so that the statement above is generated properly.</p><h3>All Test Cases (Visible + Hidden)</h3><table border = "1"><tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th><tr><td></td><td>India has 29 states and 7 union territories</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>India has 29 states and 7 union territories</td></tr></table><hr><hr><h2>ASCII Art (p1v2d1)</h2><hr>Write code to generate the following design. Such creations are often called "ASCII art". Search for them online to learn more.<br><br />
We can reveal that only space, pipe, underscore, backslash and forward slash characters were used to create this (i.e. no tab characters were used). We can also reveal that there are 2 spaces between the vertical lines of the first two "I" characters and there are 4 spaces between the vertical lines of the "I" and "T" characters as well as 4 spaces between the vertical lines of the "T" and "K" characters.<br><br />

I want to swap the values of these two variables i.e. I want the variable a to contain the value 7 and the variable b to contain the value 3. According to what I was taught, I wrote the following code. But the result is not what I expected. What is happening here? Can you help me write code to swap these numbers properly? <br><br />
<br />
Hint: Use the third variable c to implement the swap.<br />
Request: Please do not cheat by directly modifying the printf statement to print the desired values.<h3>All Test Cases (Visible + Hidden)</h3><table border = "1"><tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th><tr><td></td><td>a = 7, b = 3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>a = 7, b = 3</td></tr></table><hr><hr><h2>Area under a curve (p1v4d1)</h2><hr>The following code tries to find the area under the curve $$y = 2x^2 + 4x + 9$$ between x = 0 and x = 3 and prints the answer. The answer is an integer since it is week 1 of the course :) However, the code is not working properly, as you can check yourself. What is going wrong? Can you correct the code for me?<h3>All Test Cases (Visible + Hidden)</h3><table border = "1"><tr><th>Input</th><th>Output</th><tr><td></td><td>The area under the curve is 63</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>The area under the curve is 63</td></tr></table><hr><hr></body>
